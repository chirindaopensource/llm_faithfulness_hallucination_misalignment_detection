        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides a Python implementation of the methodologies presented in the 2025 paper \"Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models.\" The core of this repository is the iPython Notebook `faithfulness_hallucination_misalignment_detection_draft.ipynb`, which contains a comprehensive suite of functions to replicate the paper's findings, from initial configuration validation to the final calculation of the SDM scores and a full suite of robustness checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional hallucination detection methods often measure the diversity of answers to a single, fixed prompt. This can fail to distinguish between a healthy, multifaceted answer and a genuinely unstable, confabulatory one. This project implements the SDM framework, which introduces a more rigorous, prompt-aware methodology.\n",
        "\n",
        "This codebase enables users to:\n",
        "-   Rigorously validate and structure a complete experimental configuration using Pydantic.\n",
        "-   Automatically generate a high-quality corpus of semantically equivalent prompt paraphrases.\n",
        "-   Efficiently generate a matrix of LLM responses using fault-tolerant, asynchronous API calls.\n",
        "-   Transform the raw text corpus into a shared semantic topic space via joint embedding and hierarchical clustering.\n",
        "-   Calculate a full suite of information-theoretic (JSD, KL Divergence) and geometric (Wasserstein Distance) metrics.\n",
        "-   Aggregate these metrics into the final, interpretable scores for **Semantic Instability ($S_H$)** and **Semantic Exploration (KL)**.\n",
        "-   Execute a full suite of robustness checks to validate the stability of the framework itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theoretical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "The implemented methods are grounded in information theory, statistics, and natural language processing, providing a quantitative framework for measuring the alignment between a prompt and a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Ensemble-Based Testing:**\n",
        "The core innovation is to test for a deeper form of arbitrariness. Instead of just generating $N$ answers to a single prompt $Q$, the framework first generates $M$ semantically equivalent paraphrases $\\{Q_1, ..., Q_M\\}$. Then, for each $Q_m$, it generates $N$ answers. This $M \\times N$ response matrix allows for the measurement of consistency across both multiple answers *and* multiple prompt phrasings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Joint Semantic Clustering:**\n",
        "All sentences from both the $M$ prompts and the $M \\times N$ answers are embedded into a common high-dimensional vector space. A single clustering algorithm (Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering with Ward's linkage) is applied to this joint set of embeddings. This creates a shared, discrete \"topic space\" where semantically similar sentences are assigned the same topic label, regardless of whether they came from a prompt or a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Semantic Divergence Metrics:**\n",
        "From the topic assignments, topic probability distributions are created for the prompts ($P$) and the answers ($A$). The divergence between these is quantified using:\n",
        "-   **Jensen-Shannon Divergence ($D_{JS}$):** A symmetric, bounded measure of the dissimilarity between the prompt and answer topic distributions.\n",
        "    $$ D_{JS}(P||A) = \\frac{1}{2}(D_{KL}(P||M) + D_{KL}(A||M)), \\quad M = \\frac{1}{2}(P+A) $$\n",
        "-   **Wasserstein Distance ($W_d$):** A measure of the geometric shift between the raw embedding clouds, capturing changes in meaning that might not be reflected in the topic distributions.\n",
        "-   **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence ($D_{KL}$):** An asymmetric measure of \"surprise.\" The paper identifies $D_{KL}(A||P)$ as a powerful indicator of **Semantic Exploration**â€”the degree to which the LLM must introduce new concepts not present in the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Final Aggregated Scores:**\n",
        "These components are combined into the final, normalized scores:\n",
        "-   **Semantic Instability ($S_H$):** The primary hallucination score.\n",
        "    $$ S_H = \\frac{w_{jsd} \\cdot D_{JS}^{ens} + w_{wass} \\cdot W_d}{H(P)} $$\n",
        "-   **Semantic Exploration (KL Score):**\n",
        "    $$ KL(\\text{Answer| |Prompt}) = \\frac{D_{KL}^{ens}(A || P)}{H(P)} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided iPython Notebook (`faithfulness_hallucination_misalignment_detection_draft.ipynb`) implements the full research pipeline, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Configuration Pipeline:** A robust, Pydantic-based validation system for all experimental parameters.\n",
        "-   **High-Performance Data Generation:** Asynchronous API calls for efficient generation of the paraphrase and response corpora, with built-in fault tolerance and retry logic.\n",
        "-   **Rigorous Analytics:** Elite-grade, modular functions for each stage of the analysis, from embedding and clustering to the final metric calculations, leveraging optimized libraries like `scipy` and `scikit-learn`.\n",
        "-   **Automated Orchestration:** A master function that runs the entire end-to-end workflow with a single call.\n",
        "-   **Comprehensive Validation:** A full suite of robustness checks to analyze the framework's sensitivity to hyperparameters, model substitutions, and statistical noise.\n",
        "-   **Full Research Lifecycle:** The codebase covers the entire research process from configuration to final, validated scores, providing a complete and transparent replication package.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology Implemented\n",

        "The core analytical steps directly implement the methodology from the paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Configuration Validation (Task 1):** The pipeline ingests a configuration dictionary and rigorously validates its schema, constraints, and content.\n",
        "2.  **Environment Setup (Task 2):** It establishes a deterministic, reproducible computational environment and initializes all models and clients.\n",
        "3.  **Paraphrase Generation (Task 3):** It generates and validates `M` semantically equivalent paraphrases of the original prompt.\n",
        "4.  **Response Generation (Task 4):** It generates and validates an `M x N` matrix of responses.\n",
        "5.  **Sentence Segmentation (Task 5):** It deconstructs all texts into a cataloged, sentence-level corpus.\n",
        "6.  **Embedding Generation (Task 6):** It transforms the sentence corpus into a validated, high-dimensional vector space.\n",
        "7.  **Clustering (Task 7):** It determines the optimal number of topics (`k*`) and partitions the embedding space into `k*` clusters.\n",
        "8.  **Distribution Construction (Task 8):** It translates the discrete cluster labels into numerically stable probability distributions.\n",
        "9.  **Metric Computation (Tasks 9-10):** It calculates the full suite of information-theoretic and geometric metrics.\n",
        "10. **Score Aggregation (Task 11):** It synthesizes all intermediate metrics into the final, interpretable SDM scores and validates them against paper benchmarks.\n",
        "11. **Orchestration & Robustness (Tasks 12-13):** Master functions orchestrate the main pipeline and the optional, full suite of robustness checks.\n",

        "\n",
        "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinationsâ€”critical failure modes where models generate non-factual, nonsensical, or unfaithful text. This paper introduces **Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM)**, a novel, lightweight framework for detecting a specific class of these errors: *faithfulness hallucinations*.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core Problem:**\n",
        "We focus on *confabulations*, defined as responses that are both arbitrary and semantically misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods, such as Semantic Entropy, test for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed prompt, making them insufficiently prompt-aware.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methodological Framework:**\n",
        "Our SDM framework provides a more rigorous, prompt-aware methodology with two key innovations:\n",
        "*   **Ensemble-Based Testing:** We test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent paraphrases of the original prompt.\n",
        "*   **Joint Semantic Clustering:** We use joint clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for both prompts and answers, enabling a direct, quantitative comparison of their semantic content.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Metrics and Findings:**\n",
        "From this shared topic space, we compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure the semantic divergence between prompts and responses.\n",
        "*   Our primary practical score, **$S_H$**, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the Wasserstein distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a likely faithfulness hallucination.\n",
        "*   Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence, $KL(\\text{Answer} || \\text{Prompt})$, as a powerful indicator of **Semantic Exploration**â€”a key signal for distinguishing between different generative behaviors like factual recall versus creative elaboration.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Contribution:**\n",
        "These metrics are combined into the **Semantic Box**, a diagnostic framework for classifying distinct LLM response types, including the dangerous, yet common, \"confident confabulation.\" Our work provides a principled, prompt-aware methodology for the real-time detection of faithfulness hallucinations and semantic misalignment in black-box LLMs."

        "\n",
        "### **Summary of \"Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models\" by Igor Halperin**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. The Core Problem: Redefining and Detecting \"Faithfulness Hallucinations\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper begins by focusing on a specific and critical type of LLM failure: **intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations**. These are not errors of fact-checking against the real world, but rather instances where the model's response deviates semantically from the provided prompt and context.\n",
        "\n",
        "The author makes a key terminological choice, preferring the term **\"confabulation\"** from psychiatry. This term aptly describes a response that is arbitrary and semantically misaligned with the user's query, generated to \"fill in the gaps\" without deceptive intent. The central thesis is that a faithful response must remain semantically aligned with the \"world\" defined by the prompt. A confabulation is, therefore, a severe form of **semantic misalignment**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Critique of Existing Methods (e.g., Semantic Entropy)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper identifies a critical limitation in existing black-box detection methods like Semantic Entropy (SE). SE works by generating multiple answers from a *single, fixed prompt* and measuring their semantic diversity (entropy).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The Flaw:** This approach is fundamentally **\"prompt-agnostic.\"** It cannot distinguish between:\n",
        "    *   **a)** A high-entropy, unstable, and likely confabulated set of responses.\n",
        "    *   **b)** A high-entropy, rich, and perfectly valid set of responses to a complex, multifaceted prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "By failing to account for the prompt's own complexity, SE can mistakenly flag a good, detailed answer as a hallucination.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. The Proposed Methodology: Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The SDM framework is designed to be explicitly **\"prompt-aware.\"** It operates in a series of well-defined steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Step 1: Data Generation & Prompt Augmentation:** To robustly test for arbitrariness, the method doesn't rely on a single prompt. Instead, it generates `M` semantically equivalent **paraphrases** of the original prompt. For each paraphrase, it then generates `N` answers from the target LLM (using temperature sampling to induce diversity). This creates a rich ensemble of prompt-answer pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Step 2: Creating a Shared Semantic Space:** This is a crucial innovation. All sentences from *both* the paraphrased prompts and the generated answers are segmented and embedded into a high-dimensional vector space using a sentence-transformer model. Then, **joint clustering** (hierarchical agglomerative clustering) is performed on this combined set of embeddings.\n",
        "    *   **The Benefit:** This creates a single, shared \"topic space\" where a sentence from a prompt can be assigned to the same topic cluster as a semantically similar sentence from an answer. This provides a direct, quantitative basis for comparing the thematic content of the prompts and the responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Step 3: The Information-Theoretic Toolkit:** With prompts and answers represented as probability distributions over the shared topic clusters, the framework computes a suite of metrics:\n",
        "    *   **Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD):** A symmetric metric that measures the dissimilarity between the overall prompt topic distribution and the answer topic distribution.\n",
        "    *   **Wasserstein Distance (Earth Mover's Distance):** This metric operates directly on the raw embedding clouds (before clustering). It measures the geometric \"cost\" of transforming the prompt embeddings into the answer embeddings, capturing shifts in meaning even if the high-level topics remain similar.\n",
        "    *   **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence:** The paper identifies the asymmetric `KL(Answer || Prompt)` as a particularly powerful diagnostic.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. The Key Output Metrics: Instability and Exploration**\n",
        "\n",
        "The framework distills the analysis into two primary, interpretable scores:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **The Hallucination Score (`SH`):** This is the primary score for **Semantic Instability**. It is a weighted average of the Ensemble JSD and the Wasserstein Distance, normalized by the prompt's entropy (to control for its intrinsic complexity). A high `SH` score indicates a significant, unstable semantic drift between the prompt and the response, signaling a high risk of confabulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **The Semantic Exploration Score (`KL(Answer || Prompt)`):** This score quantifies the degree to which the LLM had to \"invent\" or \"explore\" new semantic territory not explicitly present in the prompt.\n",
        "    *   **Low KL:** Suggests a task of recall or synthesis within a closed conceptual space (e.g., summarizing a provided text).\n",
        "    *   **High KL:** Signals a task requiring creativity, interpretation, or invention, where the prompt acts as a \"generative scaffold\" (e.g., \"Write a story about...\").\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **5. The Diagnostic Framework: The \"Semantic Box\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper's most significant practical contribution is combining these two scores into a 2x2 diagnostic grid called the **Semantic Box**. This allows for a nuanced classification of LLM behavior beyond a simple \"hallucination/not hallucination\" binary.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **X-Axis:** Semantic Instability (`SH`)\n",
        "*   **Y-Axis:** Semantic Exploration (`KL`)\n",
        "\n",
        "The four quadrants represent distinct response modes:\n",
        "*   **Red Box (Low Instability, Low Exploration):** The most dangerous state. This is the signature of a **Confident Hallucination**, where the model converges on a stable, consistent, but entirely fabricated answer to a nonsensical or difficult prompt. It can also be a benign, simple echoic response.\n",
        "*   **Green Box (High Instability, Low Exploration):** **Faithful Factual Recall**. A good factual answer requires synthesizing diverse facts, leading to some \"healthy\" instability, but operates within the prompt's conceptual space (low exploration).\n",
        "*   **Yellow Box (Low Instability, High Exploration):** **Faithful Interpretation**. The model consistently generates new, relevant details for an interpretive task (e.g., analyzing a theme in *Hamlet*).\n",
        "*   **Orange Box (High Instability, High Exploration):** **Creative Generation**. The expected behavior for a purely creative task, characterized by high diversity and the introduction of many new concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **6. Experimental Validation and Key Findings**\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors conducted two sets of experiments that validated the framework:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Finding 1:** The SDM scores (`SH` and `KL`) correctly tracked a \"stability gradient\" from factual (Hubble) to interpretive (Hamlet) to creative (AGI Dilemma) prompts, while the baseline Semantic Entropy failed, producing counter-intuitive results.\n",
        "*   **Finding 2 (Most Critical):** In a second experiment, a deliberately nonsensical prompt (\"Forced Hallucination\" about QCD and Baroque music) produced the **lowest `SH` (instability) score** of all prompts. This empirically confirmed the signature of the \"Confident Hallucination\" in the Red Box: the model defaulted to a highly stable, consistent, but completely fabricated \"evasion strategy.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **7. Conclusion and Future Directions**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper concludes that the SDM framework provides a principled, prompt-aware, and multi-faceted method for detecting confabulations and diagnosing LLM behavior. It moves beyond a single, universal score, arguing that context (i.e., the nature of the prompt) is essential. Future work includes large-scale validation, developing a self-calibrating version of the framework, and adapting it to measure \"groundedness\" in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems."
